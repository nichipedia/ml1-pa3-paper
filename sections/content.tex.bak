\section{Voice Features for detecting Parkinsons Disease}
    Detecting Parkinsons Disease can be difficult. 
    It takes time and many visits to correctly identify the early stages of motor function issues.
    Detecting Parkinsons early can drastically help with its treatment.
    One of the earliest indicators of Parkinsons is vocal impairment.
    This means that detecting vocal impairments that are linked to Parkinsons could be a way to detect Parkinsons extremely early.


\section{Feature Extraction}
    The features are extracted from the recorded audio via algorithms.
