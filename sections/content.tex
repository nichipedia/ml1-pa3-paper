\section{Voice Features for detecting Parkinsons Disease}
    Detecting Parkinsons Disease can be difficult. 
    It takes time and many visits to correctly identify the early stages of motor function impairments.
    Detecting Parkinsons early can drastically help with its treatment.
    One of the earliest indicators of Parkinsons is vocal impairment.
    This means that detecting vocal impairments that are linked to Parkinsons could be a way to detect Parkinsons  earlier.
    People with Parkinson's typically display a variety of vocal symptoms that include issues with vowel sounds and articulating speach \cite{little}.
    Issues with producing vowels (\textit{dysphinia}) can include: volume control, bretiness, roughness, and exagerated vocal tremor \cite{little}.
    These issues can be represented as features in a dataset, and then used to predict Parkinson's.


\section{Feature Extraction}
    The features were generated from human voice audio recordings \cite{little}.
    These recordings were created in a controlled setting with identical microphones across genders and age ranges.
    Along with varying progression stages of the disease. 
    Several algorithms for extracting features were applied to this dataset.
    The authors implemented a \textit{Fractal Scaling Analysis} model for detecting hoarseness with great effect \cite{McSharry}.
    As stated above, Dysphonia features are potential predictors. 
    The authors used \textit{Nonlinear Time Series Analysis} tools for extracting these features.
    Tools such as correlation dimensions, recurrence period density entropy, and Detrended fluctuation analysis were used for this extraction.
